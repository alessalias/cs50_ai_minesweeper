An AI agent that plays the classic **Minesweeper** game using propositional logic, knowledge-based inference, and constraint satisfaction techniques.

This project is part of **CS50's Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python** and showcases reasoning under uncertainty, structured knowledge representation, and algorithmic problem-solving.

## 🚀 Overview

The project contains:

- A full **Minesweeper game engine**
- A **Sentence** class representing logical constraints
- A **MinesweeperAI** class that infers safe moves and mines
- A **runner script** to observe the AI playing
- **Unit tests** verifying state updates and inference correctness

The AI deduces information logically rather than guessing randomly.

> **Note on Comments:**  
> This project contains an unusually high number of comments, some of which may appear overly verbose or repetitive.  
> In several places, the comments restate the assignment specifications or describe logic that may seem self-evident.  
> This is intentional: the comments were written to keep all reasoning visible directly within the script and to help me re-trace the thought process behind certain design decisions when revisiting the code in the future.

## 🧩 How the AI Works

### 1. Knowledge Representation  
The AI stores logical constraints as sentences.  
Each sentence looks like:

```
{(x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3)} = 2
```

Meaning:  
> *Exactly 2 of these cells contain mines.*

### 2. Inference  
The AI infers:

- **Known mines** if `len(cells) == count`
- **Known safe cells** if `count == 0`
- **New sentences** when an existing sentence is a subset of another

Example:

```
{A, B, C} = 2  
{A, B}    = 1
-------------
{C}       = 1   → C is a mine
```

### 3. Knowledge Updating  
When the AI clicks a safe cell:

1. Records the move  
2. Marks it as safe  
3. Creates a new logical sentence from its neighbors  
4. Updates all sentences  
5. Applies inference until no new information can be derived  

### 4. Choosing Moves  
The agent will always choose:

- A **safe move**, if one is known  
- Otherwise a **random unplayed cell**

## ▶️ Running the Project

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the game:

```bash
python runner.py
```

You can modify the board size or number of mines inside `runner.py`.

## 🧪 Testing

> **Note:** The `test_minesweeper.py` file is not a formal unit test suite.  
> It is a debugging tool I created to visualize game states and AI decisions directly in the terminal using ASCII rendering.  
> It allows me to run controlled scenarios with fixed parameters without using `runner.py`, making it easier to inspect and verify the AI’s logic during development.
